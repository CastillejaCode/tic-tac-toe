--Practicing using modular programming--
--Factory functions and IIFE--

Click anywhere to start the game.

Default state is to allow two players to go compete against one another.

Default match score threshold is set to 5 games, which can be changed to 3 or 7 and can be changed in the middle of the game if you so desire.

Player names can be changed, simply click on the field. Names will be updated in the game completion message.

Player 1 must be X, Player 2 must be 0.

When one game is finished, the loser will go first next game.

The board will be automatically reset after 3 seconds if the players do not reset the board manually.

The board will not be reset automatically if the match is over; the player must reset the board, or bask in being the new champion for some time.

The "Reset Scores" button resets the current board and all scores.

The "Restart Game" button resets the current board but saves scores.

The "Computer" button allows Player 1 to compete against a computer, at which point in time allows only 1 difficutly setting, which is quite easy as the computer only picks random spots.

The Computer Button can be turned on or off in the middle of a game.

Enjoy.
